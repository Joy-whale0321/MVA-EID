Access Samples

To create file lists from our file catalog for use in analysis macros you can use

 CreateFileList.pl

which is installed centrally. Without args it prints out a quick usage summary, the file types may vary depending on what we have. Currently use -run 40 but run=4 is still somewhat available but you should not use it (different g4 version, more outdated geometry, no tracks). It gets updated frequently to add new things, just enter:

 CreateFileList.pl

Different productions (means different GEANT4 configurations) are stored as different runs. Right now you can get

 --run 40  default setting: old geometric hcals (use Enable::HCALIN_OLD = true; Enable::HCALOUT_OLD = true;)
 --run 50  gdml based hcals (default, but not up to date gdml files)

to get the up to date options. As of 9/14/2022 you get the following:

 usage: CreateFileLists.pl -type <production type> <filetypes>
 parameters:
 -embed : pp embedded into hijing (only for pp types)
 -l     : last segment
 -n    : <number of events>
 -nopileup : without pileup
 -rand : randomize segments used
 -run  : runnumber
 -s    : <starting segment>
 -type : production type
   1 : hijing (0-12fm) pileup 0-12fm DELETED
   2 : hijing (0-4.88fm) pileup 0-12fm DELETED
   3 : pythia8 pp MB
   4 : hijing (0-20fm) pileup 0-20fm
   5 : hijing (0-12fm) pileup 0-20fm DELETED
   6 : hijing (0-4.88fm) pileup 0-20fm
   7 : HF pythia8 Charm
   8 : HF pythia8 Bottom
   9 : HF pythia8 Charm D0
   10 : HF pythia8 Bottom D0
   11 : JS pythia8 Jet ptmin = 30GeV
   12 : JS pythia8 Jet ptmin = 10GeV
   13 : JS pythia8 Photon Jet
   14 : Single Particles
   15 : Special Productions

 -pileup : pileup rate selection (default = 1)
     1 : 50kHz for Au+Au, 3MHz for p+p (default)
     2 : 25kHz for Au+Au
     3 : 10kHz for Au+Au
 
 Single particle mandatory options:
   -particle : G4 particle name
   -pmin : minimum momentum (in MeV/c)
   -pmax : maximum momentum (in MeV/c)

 Special production mandatory options:
   -production : production name

 available file types (choose at least one, --> means: written to):
 DST_BBC_G4HIT  --> dst_bbc_g4hit.list
 DST_CALO_CLUSTER  --> dst_calo_cluster.list
 DST_CALO_G4HIT  --> dst_calo_g4hit.list
 DST_TRACKS  --> dst_tracks.list
 DST_TRACKSEEDS  --> dst_trackseeds.list
 DST_TRKR_CLUSTER  --> dst_trkr_cluster.list
 DST_TRKR_G4HIT  --> dst_trkr_g4hit.list
 DST_TRKR_HIT  --> dst_trkr_hit.list
 DST_TRKR_HIT_DISTORT  --> dst_trkr_hit_distort.list
 DST_TRUTH  --> dst_truth.list
 DST_TRUTH_DISTORT  --> dst_truth_distort.list
 DST_TRUTH_G4HIT  --> dst_truth_g4hit.list
 DST_TRUTH_JET  --> dst_truth_jet.list
 DST_VERTEX  --> dst_vertex.list
 G4Hits  --> g4hits.list

If you want to combine file types (e.g. analyze calo clusters and tracks together), put all types on the command line. E.g.

 CreateFileList.pl -type 4 -run 40 DST_CALO_CLUSTER DST_TRACKS -s 300

will create two lists, dst_calo_cluster.list and dst_tracks.list with matching segments for our 0-20fm dataset, starting with segment 300. If you give the number of events with -n <number of events> it will stop adding new files to the list when the requested number of events is reached. Though you can also limit the number of events in your Fun4All macro
